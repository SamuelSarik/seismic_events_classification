# Abstract
The subject of the diploma thesis is the use of deep learning methods in the field of seismology. Specifically, it is a classification of seismic signals from seismic measurements into two classes. The first target class is represented by earthquakes and the second by explosions. The presented work focuses on neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks and training of models on a data set. This problem is effectively solved with the help of data preprocessing techniques. The results of this work provide better results compared to published results.
